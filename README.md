## My Web Application (Title)


Hej! Welcome to our scheduler reminder web dev application. More to come. 


Hej is an interactive mobile-friendly application that lets users set and keep track of reminders they have accomplished. Through visually appealing layout and design, users can gain a sense of accomplishment and management of their busy schedules. Hej allows the user to set a custom profile with a photo and short description. The reminders page writes the inputs of the user into the database which then is read by the other functions to the application. Data from the user is represented by a visually appealing clock that has a color-based system for helping the user identify patterns in their schedules. As the color changes to black, the user is reminded that setting too many reminders and attempting to accomplish too many things can have a negative result.
